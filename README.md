# Part 1: Technical Documentation #
**Context and Objective**
In this initial phase, you will focus on creating comprehensive technical documentation that will serve as the foundation for the development of the HBnB Evolution application. This documentation will help in understanding the overall architecture, the detailed design of the business logic, and the interactions within the system.

**Problem Description**
You are tasked with documenting the architecture and design of a simplified version of an AirBnB-like application, named HBnB Evolution. The application will allow users to perform the following primary operations:

**User Management:** Users can register, update their profiles, and be identified as either regular users or administrators.

**Place Management:** Users can list properties (places) they own, specifying details such as name, description, price, and location (latitude and longitude). Each place can also have a list of amenities.

**Review Management:** Users can leave reviews for places they have visited, including a rating and a comment.

**Amenity Management:** The application will manage amenities that can be associated with places.

## Business Rules and Requirements ##

**User Entity**

Each user has a first name, last name, email, and password.
Users can be identified as administrators through a boolean attribute.
Users should be able to register, update their profile information, and be deleted.

**Place Entity**

Each place has a title, description, price, latitude, and longitude.
Places are associated with the user who created them (owner).
Places can have a list of amenities.
Places can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.

**Review Entity**

Each review is associated with a specific place and user, and includes a rating and comment.
Reviews can be created, updated, deleted, and listed by place.

**Amenity Entity**

Each amenity has a name, and description.
Amenities can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.
Each object should be uniquely identified by a ID.
For audit reasons, the creation and update datetime should be registered for all entities.

## Architecture and Layers ##

The application follows a layered architecture divided into:
**Presentation Layer:** This includes the services and API through which users interact with the system.

**Business Logic Layer:** This contains the models and the core logic of the application.

**Persistence Layer:** This is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.

### Persistence ###
All data will be persisted in a database, which will be specified and implemented in Part 3 of the project.

### Tasks ###
**High-Level Package Diagram**

Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern.
Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer

Design a detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer, focusing on the User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities, including their attributes, methods, and relationships. Ensure to include the relationships between Places and Amenities.
Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

Develop sequence diagrams for at least four different API calls to show the interaction between the layers and the flow of information. Suggested API calls include user registration, place creation, review submission, and fetching a list of places.
Documentation Compilation

Compile all diagrams and explanatory notes into a comprehensive technical document.

**Conditions and Constraints**

The documentation must clearly represent the interactions and flow of data between the different layers of the application.
Use UML notation for all diagrams to ensure consistency and clarity.
The business rules and requirements outlined above must be reflected accurately in the diagrams.
Ensure that the diagrams are detailed enough to guide the implementation phase in the next parts of the project.

**Expected Outcome**
By the end of this part, you should have a complete set of technical documentation that provides a clear and detailed blueprint for the HBnB Evolution application. This documentation will not only guide you through the implementation phases but also ensure that you have a solid understanding of the application’s design and architecture.

Good luck, and remember to leverage the provided resources and your own research to overcome any challenges you encounter!
